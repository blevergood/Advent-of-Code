# Advent of Code (AoC) Solutions

### Solutions provided in Python 3.11

## Folder Contents

Each day's directory contains the following:

1. A `README` with:
    - Problem summaries
    - The original Problem Statement from the AoC website
    - The solution for each of the two parts given my specific input
2. A `requirements.txt` file if any external libraries are used (though I generally try to avoid this for these challenges).
3. One or more `example.txt` file(s) with the example input from the Problem Statement. This is a simple case for the given problem and good for initial testing.
4. A `puzzle input.txt` file with official input from the website, and upon which the solutions are based. It is my understanding that this input is different for each participant
4. A Python file with the solution code. Executing this file will print the solution for each of the two parts for that day
